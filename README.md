[swhid] is an [OCaml] library to work with [persistent identifiers] found in [Software Heritage], also known as swhid. It provides:

* a parser and a printer for swhid
* functions to compute a swhid for a given object (content, directory, revision, release, snapshot)
* functions to query the swh API in order to get an URL from which you can download a given object 

## Installation

`swhid` can be installed with [opam]:

```sh
opam install swhid
```

If you don't have `opam`, you can install it following the [how to install opam] guide.

If you don't use `opam`, consult the [opam file] for build instructions.

## Quickstart

```ocaml
let id = "swh:1:rev:db21f0afdb54c16b265754ca599869fda0ca4bfc"
let id = Swhid.Parse.from_string id
let url =
  match id with
  | Error _e -> None
  | Ok id ->
    match Swhid.Download.revision (Swhid.Lang.get_object_id id) with
    | Ok url -> Some url
    | Error _e -> None

let () =
  match url with
  | None -> Format.eprintf "can't get download URL@."
  | Some url -> Format.printf "you can download the revision at the URL: `%s`@." url
```
